    **CRITICAL: All substitutions must comply with dietary restrictions - ZERO EXCEPTIONS.**
    **CRITICAL: Maximize flavor and texture similarity to original ingredients.**
    
    **Innovation Principles:**
    1. **Flavor Preservation**: Maintain/enhance original taste profiles (TOP PRIORITY)
    2. **Texture Optimization**: Ensure proper mouthfeel and consistency (TOP PRIORITY)
    3. **Culinary Function**: Preserve cooking properties and behavior
    4. **Accessibility**: Prioritize readily available ingredients
    5. **Cost Effectiveness**: Consider budget-friendly alternatives
    
    **CRITICAL SUBSTITUTION RULES:**
    - NEVER use generic terms like "gluten-free flour", "dairy-free milk", "vegan cheese"
    - NEVER use generic terms like "gluten-free bread", "dairy-free yogurt", "vegan butter"
    - ALWAYS specify exact ingredients (e.g., "almond flour", "oat milk", "cashew cheese")
    - DOUBLE-CHECK that substitutes are NOT in intolerances or exclusions
    - Verify substitutes are compatible with ALL dietary restrictions
    - Ensure substitutes are commonly available in regular food shops
    - **PRIORITIZE flavor and texture similarity over convenience**
    
    **METRIC UNIT ADAPTATION:**
    - Adapt all measurements to country standards
    - Use metric system for most countries (grams, milliliters, Celsius)
    - Use imperial system for US (ounces, cups, Fahrenheit)
    - Use appropriate measuring units for country
    
 
    **CORRECT SUBSTITUTION EXAMPLES:**
    
    **Example 1: Flour Substitution**
    ❌ WRONG: "Process cauliflower in food processor to make flour"
    ❌ WRONG: "Use gluten-free flour" (generic, may contain rice/corn)
    ✅ CORRECT: "Use chickpea flour" (similar texture and flavor to wheat flour, available in stores)
    
    **Example 2: Milk Substitution**
    ❌ WRONG: "Make homemade almond milk from scratch with blender"
    ❌ WRONG: "Use dairy-free milk" (generic, may contain soy/nuts)
    ✅ CORRECT: "Use almond milk" (similar creaminess to cow milk) OR "Use oat milk" (similar texture and mild flavor)
    
    **Example 3: Pasta Substitution**
    ❌ WRONG: "Make pasta from scratch using flour and pasta machine"
    ❌ WRONG: "Use gluten-free pasta" (generic, may contain rice/corn)
    ✅ CORRECT: "Use chickpea pasta" (similar texture and cooking behavior to wheat pasta)
    
    **Example 4: Bread Substitution**
    ❌ WRONG: "Make bread from scratch with yeast and long rising time"
    ❌ WRONG: "Use gluten-free bread" (generic, may contain rice/corn/soy)
    ✅ CORRECT: "Use almond flour bread" (similar texture and flavor) OR "Use coconut flour bread" (similar structure)
    
    **Example 5: Cheese Substitution**
    ❌ WRONG: "Use dairy-free yogurt" (generic, may contain soy/nuts)
    ✅ CORRECT: "Use coconut yogurt" (similar creaminess and tang) OR "Use cashew cheese" (similar texture and flavor)
    
    **BASE INGREDIENT SUBSTITUTIONS - SIMPLE PROCESSES ONLY:**
    
    **Example: Simple homemade when needed**
    Original: Parmesan cheese
    Substitute: Nutritional yeast mixture (only if no ready-made alternative)
    Preparation: Mix 1/2 cup nutritional yeast with 1/4 cup ground almonds + 1/2 tsp salt (similar umami flavor and texture)

    - **AVOID generic terms that may contain incompatible ingredients**
    - **ADAPT measurements to country standards**
