    - NEVER use generic terms like "gluten-free bread", "dairy-free yogurt", "vegan butter"
    - ALWAYS specify exact ingredients (e.g., "almond flour", "oat milk", "cashew cheese")

    **SUBSTITUTION PRIORITY SYSTEM:**
    
    **PRIORITY 1: High-quality, flavor/texture-similar ingredients** (ALWAYS prefer these)
    - Use ingredients that closely match original flavor and texture
    - Examples: chickpea flour (similar to wheat flour), almond milk (similar to cow milk), cashew cheese (similar to dairy cheese)
    - Simple mixing or basic preparation only
    - NO complex processing or equipment needed
    
    **PRIORITY 2: Simple homemade with optimal flavor/texture** (when ready-made unavailable)
    - Use basic ingredients available in conventional stores
    - Simple processes: mixing, soaking, basic cooking
    - NO food processors, blenders, or special equipment
    - Focus on achieving similar flavor and texture profiles
    - Examples: simple nut milk (soak + strain), basic cheese alternative (mix ingredients)
    
    **PRIORITY 3: Complex preparations** (avoid unless absolutely necessary)
    - Only when no simpler alternative exists
    - Must be essential for recipe success
    - Should use basic kitchen equipment only
    - Must achieve superior flavor/texture results

    ❌ WRONG: "Use gluten-free pasta" (generic, may contain rice/corn)

    ❌ WRONG: "Use gluten-free bread" (generic, may contain rice/corn/soy)

    ✅ CORRECT: "Use coconut yogurt" (similar creaminess and tang) OR "Use cashew cheese" (similar texture and flavor)
    
    **BASE INGREDIENT SUBSTITUTIONS - SIMPLE PROCESSES ONLY:**

    Original: Parmesan cheese
    Substitute: Nutritional yeast mixture (only if no ready-made alternative)
